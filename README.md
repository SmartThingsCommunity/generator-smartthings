> Generates a SmartThings SmartApp application

## Getting started

### The No-Install Way ðŸ‘Œ

If you have NPM install (`5.2.0`+), just run the following command from a root repository directory:

```bash
npm init yo smartthings
```

> Take note of the name, missing the `generator-` prefix. This is intentional.

### Or, with Yeoman globally installed

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-smartthings using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-smartthings
```

Then generate your new project:

```bash
yo smartthings
```

- Yeoman can be too opinionated at times but is easily convinced not to be.
